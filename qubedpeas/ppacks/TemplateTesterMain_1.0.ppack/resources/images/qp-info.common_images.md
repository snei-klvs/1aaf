Image Files
=====

## What is this for?
Let's make this very clear: Any images that you need to "direct link"
to in this Patch should be here. You should not assume that a _[pod]/resources/images_
location will work. If you have to point to or link to a resource directly
(in code or HTML) then put it here and use the _../../Common.ppod/resources/images_
type of accessor path.
