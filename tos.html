                    <p>8.2.    <b>No Reliance.</b>  The Service and other information concerning the Service may concern planned or future development efforts for existing or new Company products, technology and/or services. Neither the Service nor such information are intended to be a promise or guarantee of future delivery of products, technology, services or features but merely reflect our current plans, which may change.

The illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the legality, validity, or enforceability of such provision or any other provision of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction.</p>

Company reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time by providing such revised Agreement to User or by publishing the revised Agreement on the Company’s (or its relevant affiliate’s) website.
