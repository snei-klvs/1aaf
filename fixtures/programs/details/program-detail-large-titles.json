They evaded justice for years, sometimes decades, by using all means necessary, until law enforcement finally caught up to them. Along with a re-enactment of the story, each episode features a prison interview with the one-time fugitive, who tells of his adventures while on the run, how he survived and stayed one step ahead of the law ... and how he almost got away with it.
