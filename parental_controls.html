<h2>About Ratings and Parental Controls</h2>
<h3>About Ratings</h3>
<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment Network America LLC provides product descriptions and ratings information as a matter of convenience for all users and not as a substitute for parental oversight. Parents are encouraged to review each piece of content prior to purchase or viewing.<br>
Some content has not been rated by any organization. Parents are encouraged to review each piece of content prior to purchase or viewing.</p>

<h3>About Game Content Ratings in the Americas, except Brazil</h3>
<p>We understand that it can be difficult to tell which games are appropriate for children just by looking at the title. In order to make informed purchase decisions, parents and other consumers should check the rating of video games. The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) independently applies and enforces ratings adopted by the entertainment software industry.<br>
  <br>
The ESRB rating system has two parts: rating symbols, which are printed on the front of each PlayStation® game box, and content descriptors, which are printed on the back. Rating symbols suggest age appropriateness for the game, and content descriptors indicate elements in a game that may have triggered a particular rating and/or may be of interest or concern.<br>
<br>
To take full advantage of the ESRB rating system, it's important to check both the rating symbol (on the front of the game box) and the content descriptors (on the back of the game box).</p>

Adults Only or AO ratings are rare. PlayStation® does not publish Adults Only games.</p>

<p><strong>ESRB Content Descriptors</strong></p>
<p>Content descriptors are short, standardized phrases that indicate elements in a game that may have triggered a particular rating and, or may be of interest or concern. To fully understand what to expect from a game, parents should check both the content descriptors and the rating symbol.<br>
Following are some of the more frequently used content descriptors on PlayStation® games.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Animated Blood - Cartoon or pixilated depictions of blood.</li>
	<li>Blood- Depictions of blood.</li>
	<li>Comic Mischief - Scenes depicting slapstick or gross vulgar humor.</li>
	<li>Language - Mild to moderate use of profanity.</li>
	<li>Mild Violence - Mild scenes depicting characters in unsafe and/or violent situations.</li>

<h3>PlayStation™ Network Parental Controls</h3>
<p>PlayStation™ Network (“PSN”) offers parental controls for Sub Accounts. A Sub Account can be created for a child under 18 by a parent or guardian who holds a Master Account (See the PlayStation™ Network Terms of Service and User Agreement for details). The Master Account holder can restrict a Sub Account's participation in PSN using the settings described below. The Master Account can also edit these settings by signing in to PSN, then going to (PlayStation™ Network or PSN) &gt; [Account Management] &gt; [Sub Account Management] &gt; [Parental Control].</p>
<p>Although PSN parental control settings control an account's activities throughout PSN, they restrict content in different ways on different PlayStation™ systems. The PS4 system honors Chat and User Generated Media ("UGM") controls (described below) separately. PS3 and PS Vita systems honor one control, Chat, that covers the content in both categories.</p>
<p>For example, if a Master Account sets the chat parental control on a PS3 system to restrict Chat, both Chat and UGM will be restricted on a PS4 system. If a Master Account sets the Chat or UGM parental control on a PS4 system, both Chat and UGM will be restricted on a PS3 system.</p>

<h3>Chat</h3>
<p>This control blocks a Sub Account from using text chat, voice chat, video chat, and other messaging features, from communicating directly with other users in games or via system software features. Please note that when this control is set to block, a Sub Account can still A) send and receive predetermined text messages created by a game or app, B) create and see other users' in-game character names, designs, and clan titles, C) use communication services via the Internet Browser unless specifically disabled and D) communicate via system messaging on PS3 and PS Vita systems, E) communicate via third party, non-game apps. Please use the Grief Report system to report all offensive or inappropriate behavior or content.</p>
<p>The default setting is "Block" meaning chat is restricted. </p>

<h3>User Generated Media ("UGM")</h3>
<p>This parental control blocks a Sub Account from posting or viewing user-generated content (including photos, videos, drawings, and content imported from outside sources). This control does not affect content shared using chat and messaging functions, which can be disabled using the Chat control. This control will not prevent video capture of the sub account user's online gameplay.</p>
<p>The default setting is "Block" meaning chat is restricted. </p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>This setting allows a Master Account holder to A) prevent a Sub Account from buying game content through PSN that not intended for his/her age according to the ESRB rating system and B) prevent a Sub Account from playing software content on PSN that is not intended for his age according to the ESRB rating system.</p>
<p>The default value is set to "On" meaning content will be restricted based on user age.</p>
<p>If this restriction is removed, a Sub Accounts will be able to buy and play any content, including content that is not intended for his/her age or may be inappropriate according to the ESRB rating system.</p>

<h3>Monthly Spending Limit</h3>
<p>With this setting, a Master Account holder can set a monthly limit spending limit for a Sub Account to spend per month if the Master Account wallet has sufficient funds.</p>
<p>The default value is set to "$0.00" meaning the Sub Account cannot make any purchases.</p>
