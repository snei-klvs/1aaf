          <span>How much bandwidth do I need?</span>
          <ul>
            <li>10 Mbps or higher is recommended for the best experience, plus 5 Mbps for every additional stream on Wifi.  LTE or 4G is recommended when using cellular.</li>
          </ul>

          <span>I’m having trouble streaming.</span>
          <ul>
            <li>Please check your network connection on your device.</li>
            <li>If issues persist, please restart your device and try the application again.</li>
